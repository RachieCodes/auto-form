# React Form Builder

This project is a dynamic form generation and validation system built with React. It features a drag-and-drop interface for creating forms, live previews, multi-step forms with conditional logic, and AI-generated validation rules and field suggestions. Users can also export their forms to JSON schema or embed the form code in other applications.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop UI**: Easily add and rearrange form fields using a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.
- **Live Preview**: View real-time updates of the form as it is being built.
- **Multi-Step Forms**: Create complex forms that guide users through multiple steps.
- **Conditional Logic**: Set up rules to show or hide fields based on user input.
- **AI-Generated Suggestions**: Get intelligent suggestions for form fields and validation rules.
- **Validation**: Implement regex-based backend validation for form inputs.
- **Export to JSON Schema**: Export the form configuration as a JSON schema for easy integration.
- **Embed Code**: Generate code snippets for embedding the form in other applications.
